    "## 1. Background\n",
    "Particulate matter (PM) or aerosol in the atmosphere has a large variety of sources. Particles can be organic (skin cells, plant material, bacteria, fungi, pollen) and inorganic (sand, copper, sea salt, ammonium / nitrate aerosols). Aerosol are related to visibility, health, acidification and eutrophication, erosion, etc.. As such they affect air quality. One of the lectures in the Air Quality course is dedicated to better understanding the characteristics of aerosol and the associated processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.\tObjective\n",
    "In this practical you will study the concentration of particulate matter emitted by a series of torches. By combining the measurements with the Gaussian Plume model (P01) you will be able to back calculate the concentrations to the source strength. The objective of the practical is that you learn to interpret the measurements, and that you learn to identify measurement errors and deal with them.\n",

    "On the WUR campus, between Forum and Atlas, an experiment was performed to measure black carbon concentrations downwind from a line source (Figure 1). 22 torches were positioned 40 cm apart in a row and lighted. The torches were 1.3 m tall. In this way, a line source mimicked black carbon emissions from a road. The experiment was carried out in the afternoon of 5 September 2017. The wind speed variable, was 1 – 4 m s$^{-1}$, on average 2 m s$^{-1}$. Although the direction of the line source was intended to be perpendicular to the wind direction, the wind direction in reality varied between 0 and 90 ° with an average of 30 °. The sky was partly cloudy, turning the atmosphere weakly unstable.\n",

    "Downwind from the line source, the concentrations of particulate matter were measured with 12 Dylos DC1700 Air Quality Monitors (http://www.dylosproducts.com/dc1700.html, Figure 2). The instruments were installed on small stools at an height of 0.7 m. One instrument was placed upwind from the line source, to measure the particulate matter concentrations in the background wind. The other 11 instruments were placed at 0.25, 0.60, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.75, 3.50, 4.50, 5.50, 7.00 and 8.50 m downwind from the line source. The distances between the sensors is increasing with distance from the source. This is because further away from the source, the concentrations do not change as fast anymore. \n",
    "The experiment consisted of 3 phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An initial background experiment (20 minutes from 15:24:10 to 15:43:50) when the setup was completed, but the torches not yet lighted. In this phase, the sensors measure the background concentration. The data in this phase may be used to inspect if the sensors measure the same concentrations, or if some have offsets.\n",
    "2. The experimental phase (30 minutes from 15:55:00 to 16:27:00) when the torches were lighted. The first few minutes were removed from the data, because some torches produced much more black carbon than later on. In this phase, the downwind sensors measured the background concentrations + the additional concentrations emitted by the torches.\n",
    "3. A final background experiment (6 minutes from 16:32:00 to 16:38:20) after the torches were extuinguished. In this phase, all torches measure the background concentration again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dylos particle counters measure particle numbers every 10 seconds in two size categories: small particles, i.e. all particles with a diameter larger than 0.5 μm and large particles, i.e. all particles with a diameter larger than 2.5 μm. The particles are measured as number densities # m$^{-3}$, although in the output, this is converted to 1e6 particles m$^{-3}$. 1 particle ft$^{-3}$ corresponds to 35.3 particles m$^{-3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Exercises\n",
    "To gain experience with particulate matter measurements you will investigate how the PM concentration changes downwind from the line source of black carbon. In Practical P02 Gaussian Plume Model you learned that the concentration of black carbon is highest close to the source and decreases with the distance from the source. In this practical you will test whether the observed concentrations behave like you simulated them with the Gaussian plume model, and you will use the change in concentrations to estimate the source strength. The practical will give you an idea about how many particles are emitted by torches and how this relates to emission by heavy-duty diesel trucks.\n",
