    "The Gaussian Plume Model (GPM) is a widely used tool in air pollution applications. Basically, the model is used to estimate the downwind air pollution concentrations, given information about the pollutant emissions and the nature of the atmosphere. GPMs form the basis for permits that are granted to large facilities to emit \"smelly\" or toxic compounds. But GPMs also form the basis of the Dutch model OPS that calculates Nitrogen deposition on nature areas.\n",

    "\n",
    "The GPM can be derived from the advection diffusion equation of a tracer. The basic concept is that concentrations downwind of a source spread laterally and vertically by turbulent motions in the atmospheric boundary layer. In a convective boundary, plumes will normally exhibit irregular behaviour, because of the strong turbulence and the large eddies that move the plume around. This can be observed in the movie below. The movie shows a result from a simulation of a plume in a slightly convective boundary layer (This is called a Large Eddy Simulation, courtesy: Chiel van Heerwaarden, MAQ). Note that we look at the plume from above, i.e., we look at the result plotted in xy-plane.\n",

    "Atmospheric stability describes the thermal layering of the atmosphere. This will be explained in detail in a later lecture, but here the concept will be already be introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "At **night**, the coldest air is near the surface, because the surface cools the air via emission of longwave (IR) radiation. Since colder air is denser, it is difficult to lift the surface air higher into the atmosphere. As a result, the atmosphere is **stable**: it is difficult to mix air vertically.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the **day**, the sun heats the earth's surface with solar radiation. The surface heats the lower air layers, which become warmer and expands. The expanded air is less dense and has a tendency to rise up, while the colder air above it sinks towards the surface. As a result, the atmosphere is constantly mixed by turbulent motions. In this situation, we call the atmosphere **unstable**. In practise, the situation is more complex, but for now this explanation suffices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The static stability of the atmosphere strongly determines the dispersion of air polutants. In an unstable boundary layer, plumes are constantly moved up and down by rising and sinking motions. In contrast, mixing is strongly reduced in a stable boundary layer (e.g., at night, with low winds). Figure 3 shows how plumes can behave as a function of the temperature profile in the lower atmosphere. Looping, coning, and fanning occur during respectively unstable, neutral, and stable conditions. Note that the lower three panels exhibit temperature jumps near the top of the boundary layer. Remember also that stacks are often build to release (dangerous or smelly) air pollutants at higher altitudes!\n",
